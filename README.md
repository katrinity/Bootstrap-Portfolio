# Bootstrap-Portfolio
This homework was challenging. I made a huge mistake when tried to reuse css from the previous homework. It was a big mess. So after couple hours of knocking my head agains the wall, I started everything from scratch and I did it (fingers crossed)! 

I used such bootstrap items as navbar, grid, raws, columns, sticky footer, media, etc.
My website responded when I changed screen size via Chrome extensions such as Window Resizer and Browser Width.  Then, I made few styling adjustments via CSS.

Here is a glimpse of code from contact.html page:

Looking forward to hearing your feedback!
